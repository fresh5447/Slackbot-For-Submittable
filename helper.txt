Attachment Formatting:

You have two options for sending data to the Webhook URL above:
Send a JSON string as the payload parameter in a POST request
Send a JSON string as the body of a POST request

For a simple message, your JSON payload must contain a text property. This is the text that will be posted to the channel.

A simple example:
payload={"text": "This is a line of text in a channel.\nAnd this is another line of text."}

To display a richly-formatted message attachment in Slack, you can use the same JSON payload as above, but add in an attachments array. Each element of this array is a hash containing the following parameters:

{
	"fallback": "Required text summary of the attachment that is shown by clients that understand attachments but choose not to show them.",

	"text": "Optional text that should appear within the attachment",
	"pretext": "Optional text that should appear above the formatted data",

	"color": "#36a64f", // Can either be one of 'good', 'warning', 'danger', or any hex color code

	// Fields are displayed in a table on the message
	"fields": [
		{
			"title": "Required Field Title", // The title may not contain markup and will be escaped for you
			"value": "Text value of the field. May contain standard message markup and must be escaped as normal. May be multi-line.",
			"short": false // Optional flag indicating whether the `value` is short enough to be displayed side-by-side with other values
		}
	]
}			




Customized Appearance
You can customize the name and icon of your Incoming Webhook in the Integration Settings section below.
However, you can override the displayed name by sending "username": "new-bot-name" in your JSON payload. You can also override the bot icon either with "icon_url": "https://slack.com/img/icons/app-57.png" or "icon_emoji": ":ghost:".

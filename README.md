#A SlackBot For Submittable

##This is a work in progress but the goal is to view and receive important ##Submittable updates from within Slack.

*Currently we setup a slash `/submittables` which will hit Submittables API and
return all Submissions.*

##Production Endpoint: https://slacky-mcslackington.herokuapp.com/

**ToDo's:**

*Set up a slash that returns only open/inprogree submissions.
*Create an incoming webhook that posts to Slack whenever there is
an update on a Submission (notes, status, etc.)
*Post a note to Submittable from Slack.


There is also a working dicebot that rolls a random set of dice.
